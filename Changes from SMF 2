Changes to keep in mind, for the database mainly, for upgrading from SMF 2.0/2.1 to 3.0.


1) Everything in install sql, diff-ed with SMF.
Added to which: (to note before I forget) session table structure remains the same.

2) 'forum_alias_urls' from smf_settings => 'alias_urls'






Hooks changes:
1) events
2) integrate_verify_user => core_user_preload
3) integrate_user_info => core_user_load
