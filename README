This is smCore, the basis of SMF 3
Currently this is pre-alpha so don't expect anything to stay as it is.

Before using you need to configure your settings in /path/to/smCore/other/settings.php
A database dump will also be needed.

Currently only MySQL is supported.

Frustrate's comments:

A few things about this repo:

1. It's not set up very well. Sorry about that, I'll clean it up as soon as I remember that I wrote this.

2. I tend to break things. I also change my mind a few times a week and make stupid coding decisions just as often. I usually notice my mistakes sooner or later, though.
