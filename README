A few things about this repo:

1. It's not set up very well. Sorry about that, I'll clean it up as soon as I remember that I wrote this.

2. I tend to break things. I also change my mind a few times a week and make stupid coding decisions just as often. I usually notice my mistakes sooner or later, though.

3. There are pieces of Zend Framework being used right now (Cache, Db, Mail, etc.) which will be replaced some time down the line. It's quicker to have them in place while other code is being written than to have to write everything from the start.

4. The template engine will undergo drastic changes. I'm still trying to figure out which syntax we should use, because we're definitely not going to continue with pure PHP templates.
