This is smCore, the basis of SMF 3
Currently this is pre-alpha so don't expect anything to stay as it is.
Also, don't expect it to work very well either... you are warned.

Before using you need to configure your settings in /path/to/smCore/other/settings.php
A database dump will also be needed.

Currently only MySQL is supported.
